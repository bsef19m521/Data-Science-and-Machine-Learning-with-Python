## Learning Agenda of Day 11 & 12:

- Tuple Data Structure
- Set Data Structure


### Tuple Data Structure
- How to create Tuples?
- Proof of concepts: Tuples are heterogeneous, ordered, nested, immutable, and allow duplicate elements
- Different ways to access elements of a Tuple?
- Slicing a Tuple
- Tuple concatenation and repetition
- Being immutable, you cannot add elements to a Tuple
- Being immutable, you cannot remove elemenst from a Tuple
- Converting string object to Tuple and vice-versa (using type casting, split() and join())
- Tuple methods
- Sorting a Tuple using built-in `sorted()` function

### Set Data Structure
- How to create Sets?
- Proof of concepts: Sets are heterogeneous, un-ordered, mutable, nested, and DOES NOT allow duplicate elements
- Accessing elements of sets?
- Slicing a set (can't be performed as there is no index associated with set values)
- Set concatenation and repetition (can't be performed as on list and tuples)
- Adding/Updating elements to a set using `add()`, and `update()` methods
- Removing elements from a set using `pop()`, `remove()` and `discard()` methods.
- Converting string object to set and vice-versa (using type casting, `split()` and `join()`)
- Elements of a set cannot be sorted (being unordered)
